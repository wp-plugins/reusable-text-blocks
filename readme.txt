Create reusable pieces of content that you can insert into themes, posts, pages & widgets.

== Description ==

This plugin creates a new 'text-blocks' custom post type with it's own section in the WordPress admin sidebar. It uses the standard WordPress user interface so you and your clients will know how to use it instantly. 

You can add it to your site in three ways:

Widget: Included widget allows you to specify which block you want to insert. You can also include a title if needed.

Shortcode: The listview includes a shortcode that you can insert into your pages and posts.
`[text-blocks id=1]`

PHP Function: A PHP function has been setup so you do not have to use the do_shortcode function. Go straight to the source with the following.

`<?php if(function_exists('show_text_block')) { echo show_text_block(421); } ?>`
